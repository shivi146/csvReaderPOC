# csvReaderPOC

Firstly in this project I have used the csvhelper library for reading these input files.
https://joshclose.github.io/CsvHelper/

I have written comparer to sort the flight detail list based on price and departure time.

Remove the duplicate records.
To run this project you need to gitclone this project on your system,Then open in the visual studio.
Now just run it.

All the input files(Provider1,Provider2,Provider3) are in same project directory.
